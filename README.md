This report aims to analyze housing data to determine the impact of various factors on house values. Specifically, we will explore how missing data in ‘LIVING AREA’ affects the analysis, including t-tests and
classification models and apply various machine learning techniques to predict house values.
Aims and Objectives
• Aim: To evaluate the influence of different housing characteristics on house values and the importance
of carrying out PCA analysis .
• Objectives:
1. Assess the impact of missing data in ‘LIVING AREA’.
2. Perform t-tests to compare groups based on missing values.
3. Develop classification models (Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors) on different variables to
predict house values.
4. Visualize the results for better understanding and communication.
